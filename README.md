[![Project Status: Abandoned - Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

A port of the abandoned [kdirstat](http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/) to work on KDE 4.x.

This port has been abandoned, but it appears that [Jerome Robert's k4dirstat](https://bitbucket.org/jeromerobert/k4dirstat/wiki/Home) (an unrelated port that was named the same) is still actively supported and supports KDE 5.x. Commit log will be left intact so anyone can reference the ported code.
